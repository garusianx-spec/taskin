# تسکین — Taskin

پلتفرم ارتباط و مدیریت وظایف سازمانی، راست‌به‌چپ و با تقویم هجری شمسی.

An RTL-first, Persian enterprise communication and task-management platform built on
Next.js (App Router), React and TypeScript in strict mode, styled with Tailwind CSS against
a fully tokenised Untitled UI design system. The backend (`apps/api`) is a NestJS modular
monolith on PostgreSQL, Redis and S3-compatible storage, designed in
[RFC 0001](docs/rfc/0001-backend-architecture.md) and built milestone by milestone.

---

## Running it

Node.js 22.12 or newer. Every command runs from the repository root:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev             # builds the shared packages, then http://localhost:3000 (the live app: needs the API on :4000)
NEXT_PUBLIC_DATA_SOURCE=demo npm run dev   # the same app on the in-memory demo workspace, no backend needed
npm run build           # packages, apps/api and the production build of apps/web
npm run typecheck       # every workspace (strict, noUncheckedIndexedAccess)
npm run lint            # Next rules for apps/web, typescript-eslint for packages and apps/api
npm test                # unit tests: packages/jalali, packages/text, apps/api (no services needed)
npm run check:contrast  # WCAG AA audit of every palette × mode (see Theme engine)
NEXT_PUBLIC_DATA_SOURCE=demo npm run build && npm run test:e2e   # Playwright suites (demo data), production build
API_LOG=<api log file> npm run test:e2e:live                    # two people against the running API (see Live app)

# Backend (Docker for the backing services)
npm run infra:up        # PostgreSQL 18, PgBouncer, Redis ×2, S3 (SeaweedFS), Mailpit
npm run test:int        # API integration suites against a database migrated from zero
npm run infra:app       # also builds and runs the API image (migrations first) on :4000
npm run infra:down
# The scaled topology: REST node, two WebSocket nodes, worker, nginx on :8080
docker compose -f infra/docker-compose.yml -f infra/compose.scale.yml --profile scale up -d --build --wait
```

See [apps/api/README.md](apps/api/README.md) for running the API outside Docker, its
configuration, its test layout, and the scale-out smoke test and chat load results.

The repository is an npm-workspaces monorepo:

| Path | Contents |
| --- | --- |
| `apps/web` | The Next.js app |
| `apps/api` | The NestJS API: auth, workspaces, RBAC, projects, board, tasks, files, notes, calendar, notifications, and real-time chat on a Socket.IO gateway (M1–M3 of RFC 0001) |
| `packages/contracts` | Domain types, API contracts and the permission vocabulary, shared by web and API |
| `packages/jalali` | Jalali calendar engine and Persian date formatting |
| `packages/text` | Persian text helpers: digits, Iranian mobile numbers, monograms, note Markdown and checklists, search normalisation |
| `infra` | Docker Compose stacks for local development and the scaled topology, database roles, S3 and nginx configuration |
| `docs/rfc` | Architecture decisions; the backend design is [RFC 0001](docs/rfc/0001-backend-architecture.md) |

Packages compile to `dist/`. While `npm run dev` is running, run `npm run build:packages -- --watch`
in a second terminal to pick up package edits.

`npm run test:e2e` starts `next start` on port 3100 (`E2E_PORT`), or uses `BASE_URL` if you
already run a server, and takes suite names to run a subset (`npm run test:e2e -- kanban theme`).
It needs a demo build and says so when it finds a live one (the root element carries
`data-source`). It launches Chromium from `CHROMIUM_PATH` when set, otherwise from
`npx playwright-core install chromium`. Screenshots land in `apps/web/e2e/out`.

---

## Live app

By default the web app runs against the Taskin API. Next.js proxies `/api/v1/*` and the
Socket.IO path `/rt/` to the API, so the browser only ever talks to the app's own origin: the
refresh cookie is first-party and no CORS is involved. In production the edge (nginx) routes
both paths the same way.

| Variable | Read at | Default | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_DATA_SOURCE` | build | `api` | `api` for the live app, `demo` for the in-memory fixture workspace |
| `TASKIN_API_ORIGIN` | build | `http://localhost:4000` | Where `/api/v1` and `/rt` are proxied. Rewrites are compiled into the build, so set it before `next build` |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_RT_URL` | build | the page's origin | Connect the socket to another origin instead (an edge that routes `/rt` itself) |

Locally: `npm run infra:app` (or `infra:up` plus the API from `apps/api`), then `npm run dev`.
Sign in with any Iranian mobile number; the API's console SMS driver writes the code to its log
(`"text":"کد ورود شما به تسکین: 123456"`). A new number signs up with a name and then creates
its first workspace, which asks for the admin password owners need for sensitive actions.
Invitations sent by SMS log a link (`/invite?token=…`): open it in another browser, sign in with
the invited number, and the account joins that workspace.

**How the data flows.** The reducer the screens were built on is unchanged; `store/live` feeds
it. After sign-in one round of parallel requests loads the workspace into the reducer. Every
action is applied at once (the optimistic update) and then sent to the API, which answers with
its ids, versions and placements; those replace the optimistic values, and changes made to a
still-local entity wait for its server id. A refusal is shown as a toast and the entity is
re-read; a stale version (`412`) reloads the task as it now is. Socket events — other people's
messages, typing, read cursors, reactions, presence, task and column changes, notifications,
membership and permission changes — become `sync/*` actions. The socket subscribes before the
load, so events that arrive meanwhile wait and are applied after it; after a reconnect,
`sync:resume` replays what was missed. The access token lives in memory only; the refresh token
is an HttpOnly cookie, refreshed a minute before the access token expires and once more on a
`401`. Signing out revokes the session on the server and clears both.

**Live end to end.** `npm run test:e2e:live` drives two browsers through one workspace: sign-up,
first workspace, a project, an SMS invitation accepted through its link, a task created and
assigned by one person and completed live on the other's board, a direct chat with delivery,
typing, read receipts and ❤️ / 👎 reactions, the notification quick views and «علامت‌گذاری همه
به‌عنوان خوانده‌شده», and sign-out from the profile menu. It reads codes and links from
`API_LOG` (the API's log file) and targets `BASE_URL` (default `http://localhost:3100`); any
console error or warning, hydration mismatches included, fails it. CI runs it against the
Compose API and a production build of the web app.

## Typography

`IRANYekanX` is self-hosted from `public/fonts` as WOFF2. **Two masters ship in this
repository** (Medium and ExtraBold), and `apps/web/src/styles/fonts.css` declares each `@font-face`
with a *weight range* so every step of the type scale resolves to the nearest available
master rather than being synthesised by the browser:

| Master     | `font-weight` range | Covers                                          |
| ---------- | ------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| Medium     | `400 600`           | micro-copy, body, chat, titles, table headers    |
| ExtraBold  | `700 900`           | page headers, workspace headers                  |

To add the remaining masters, drop `IRANYekanWebRegular.woff2`,
`IRANYekanWebSemiBold.woff2` or `IRANYekanWebBold.woff2` into `public/fonts` and narrow the
ranges in `fonts.css`. **No component changes are needed** — components only ever reference
weights through Tailwind's `font-*` utilities.

The type scale lives in `tailwind.config.ts` and is sized for Persian, which needs slightly
more leading than Latin at the same optical size:

| Token          | Size | Weight | Used for                                  |
| -------------- | ---- | ------ | ----------------------------------------- |
| `text-micro`   | 11px | 400    | badges, counters                          |
| `text-caption` | 12px | 400    | micro-copy, metadata                      |
| `text-body-sm` | 13px | 400/500| chat messages                             |
| `text-body`    | 14px | 400    | body copy, table cells                    |
| `text-title-sm`| 14px | 600    | tab labels, table headers                 |
| `text-title`   | 16px | 600    | section titles                            |
| `text-heading` | 18–20px | 700 | page headers                              |
| `text-display` | 24px | 800    | workspace headers                         |

### OpenType

`font-feature-settings: "ss01"` is applied document-wide on `body`, which selects the
Persian ۴/۵/۶ glyph variants. The `.numeric` utility adds `tnum` + `lnum` and
`font-variant-numeric: tabular-nums` and is applied to every numeric surface — Jalali dates,
task counters, timesheet totals, unread pills and financial tables — so digits stay aligned
in columns.

`.latin-inline` isolates Latin fragments (emails, file names, task codes) inside RTL copy
with `direction: ltr; unicode-bidi: isolate`.

---

## Theme engine

Three layers, all in `apps/web/src/styles/tokens.css`:

1. **Primitive ramps** — raw `R G B` channel triplets, so Tailwind's `<alpha-value>` slot
   works (`bg-surface/80`, `text-fg-primary/60`).
2. **Accent alias** — `--brand-50…900` is re-pointed by `[data-accent]`, together with three
   accessible anchors: `--brand-solid` (fill carrying white text), `--brand-solid-hover` and
   `--brand-ink` (brand text on light surfaces). Components never name a palette or a ramp
   step for text or fills.
3. **Semantic surfaces** — `--bg-*`, `--fg-*`, `--border-*`, `--status-*`. These flip in dark
   mode; every component reads only this layer.

### Colour modes

`data-theme="light" | "dark"` on `<html>`. "System" resolves to one of the two at runtime so
there is a single source of truth in the DOM. Dark mode is OLED Charcoal: `#0C111D`
background, `#161B26` cards, `#1F242F` borders.

### Accent palettes

Six swappable Primary 50→900 scales, selected with `data-accent`, each in light and OLED dark:

| Accent   | Name              | Primary 600 | Accessible anchors                          |
| -------- | ----------------- | ----------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| `indigo` | سازمانی پیش‌فرض    | `#3538CD`   | default (600 fill, 600 ink) — the default   |
| `teal`   | تمرکز عمیق         | `#0E766E`   | ink → 700 (600 on its hover tint is 4.46:1) |
| `violet` | استارتاپ مدرن      | `#6941C6`   | default                                     |
| `rose`   | رز شرابی           | `#9E165F`   | default                                     |
| `amber`  | گرمای سازمانی      | `#B54708`   | ring → 600 (500 is 2.2:1 on white)          |
| `ocean`  | اقیانوس عمیق       | `#088AB2`   | fill + ink → 700 (600 is 3.9:1 with white)  |

A palette keeps its 600 identity colour for borders, rings and swatches; only the steps that
carry text move where the 600 would miss AA. `npm run check:contrast` parses `tokens.css`,
resolves the cascade for all 6 palettes × 2 modes and asserts 26 text/fill pairs each (body
text, brand text on surface/canvas/tint, button fills, status and tag badges, selected-card
borders and focus rings). In dark mode `--border-brand` uses the 400 step, which clears 3:1 on
charcoal under every palette, so selected and hovered cards share one border treatment.

Custom Kanban columns and note colour tags draw from a separate fixed set of eight **tag tones**
(`--tag-*`) that do not follow the accent, so a red column stays red under every palette.

### Status tokens

Done `#027A48` · In Progress `#B54708` · Blocked `#B42318` · Todo `#667085`. In dark mode the
foreground steps lift to the 300/400 range so they clear WCAG AA on charcoal.

### No flash of the wrong palette

`THEME_BOOTSTRAP_SCRIPT` (in `apps/web/src/lib/theme.ts`) runs synchronously in `<head>` before first
paint and writes `data-theme` / `data-accent` from `localStorage` or the OS preference.
`ThemeProvider` then adopts exactly what the script applied, so React hydrates against the
attributes it would have produced itself. The theme also syncs across open tabs via the
`storage` event, and falls back to an in-memory theme when storage is blocked.

**Zero hard-coded hex values exist in any component class.** The only raw hex outside
`tokens.css` is the swatch preview in the theme picker, which must render all six palettes
at once and therefore cannot read the single active `--brand-*` variable.

---

## RTL

The document is `dir="rtl"` at the root. The codebase uses **logical properties throughout**
(`ps-`/`pe-`, `ms-`/`me-`, `start-`/`end-`, `border-s`/`border-e`, `text-start`/`text-end`)
rather than physical left/right, with `rtl:`/`ltr:` variants reserved for the few cases where
a transform has to be mirrored explicitly (the switch knob, direction-aware chevrons).

Direction-aware details that are easy to get wrong and are handled here:

- **Chevrons and arrows.** `ChevronForwardIcon` points along the reading direction (left in
  RTL); `ChevronBackwardIcon` points against it. "Previous month/week" uses *backward*
  (earlier content lies to the right in RTL); "next" uses *forward*.
- **Kanban keyboard movement.** With a card picked up, `ArrowLeft` advances to the next
  column and `ArrowRight` retreats.
- **Waveform scrubbing.** The voice player measures the click offset from the track's right
  edge, and `ArrowLeft` seeks forward.
- **Gantt.** The timeline is a CSS grid of one column per day. Because the container inherits
  `dir="rtl"`, column 1 is the right-most cell and bars run right-to-left with no coordinate
  mirroring — only `gridColumnStart` / `gridColumnEnd`.
- **Avatar stacks** use `flex-row-reverse` plus a negative inline margin so the first member
  still stacks on top.
- Separators between a word and a number use the Persian comma `،` rather than `·`, which is
  a bidi-neutral character and renders ambiguously next to digits.

---

## Jalali calendar

`packages/jalali` implements the Solar Hijri arithmetic conversion (the 33-year
leap-cycle algorithm) with no runtime dependency on `Intl`, so output is byte-identical on
every platform and ICU build. `npm test` verifies it day by day against
`Intl.DateTimeFormat('en-u-ca-persian')` across 1990–2035 (16,801 days): **zero mismatches**,
and every date round-trips back to the same Gregorian day.

It provides month grids (Saturday-first), leap-year and month-length calculation, relative
phrasing (`۵ دقیقه پیش`), chat date dividers (`امروز` / `دیروز` / weekday), deadline
descriptions (`۲ روز تأخیر`, `فردا`) and Persian-digit formatting.

### Clock-dependent rendering

These routes are statically prerendered, so the server's clock is *build* time. Anything
phrased relative to "now" would therefore never match the visitor. `useNow()` returns `null`
until mount, letting callers emit a deterministic absolute value for SSR and upgrade to live
phrasing after hydration — which also keeps timestamps ticking instead of freezing at page
load. `<RelativeTime>` wraps this in a semantic `<time>` element.

```

The domain model lives in `packages/contracts`, the Jalali engine in `packages/jalali`, and the
Persian text helpers (digits, mobile numbers, monograms, note Markdown and checklists) in
`packages/text`; the app imports them as `@taskin/contracts`, `@taskin/jalali` and
`@taskin/text`.

### Separation of concerns

`WorkspaceProvider` is the **single stateful container**. Everything below it is
presentational: it receives data and callbacks and owns no domain state. `workspace-reducer.ts`
is a pure function with a closed, exhaustively-switched action union — it has no React
import and is directly unit-testable. In the live app `LiveStore` sits beside it: the provider
applies each action to the reducer and hands it to the store, which sends it to the API and
feeds server answers and socket events back as `sync/*` actions (see Live app). The screens do
not know which data source they run on.

Every modal dialog lives in one global store, `OverlayProvider`, mounted in the root layout
above all routes. `useOverlays()` opens any of them from anywhere — the rail, a board column,
a calendar cell, a note — and they survive the route change some flows trigger (creating a
chat navigates to `/chats`, an event to `/calendar`). The store holds a single closed
`Overlay` union, so exactly one dialog is open at a time; `OverlayHost` renders each one once
and is the only place that turns their callbacks into reducer actions. It also binds the
quick-create shortcuts **N** (new task) and **M** (new chat), matched on `KeyboardEvent.code`
so they work on a Persian keyboard layout and ignored while typing. `AppShell` keeps only the
inspector, because that docks into the layout rather than floating over it.

## Modules

Navigation runs میز کار → پروژه‌ها و وظایف → گفتگوها → تقویم → یادداشت‌ها → اعضای سازمان on
the rail, and میز کار · وظایف من · گفتگوها · تقویم · بیشتر on the mobile tab bar.

- **Workspaces** — the switcher (rail badge on desktop, top bar on mobile, «بیشتر» on phones)
  lists every workspace. «ایجاد فضای کاری جدید» asks for a name, an optional description and
  an icon: an uploaded image (read locally as a data URL, images only, ≤1MB) or, without one,
  a two-letter monogram generated from the name on a chosen colour. The new workspace is
  registered and becomes active at once. Each workspace owns its own tasks, columns, chats,
  events, notes, notifications, invitations and activity; switching parks the current slices
  and restores the target's, while the account, profile, permissions and theme carry across.
  «تنظیمات فضای کاری» shows the owner and a danger zone: only the **Owner** can delete, never
  the last workspace, and only after typing the workspace's exact name and ticking an
  acknowledgement in a dialog that ignores overlay clicks.
- **Feed** — summary cards, progress, «نیاز به اقدام شما» with a quick-complete checkbox per
  task (a task ticked here stays listed, struck through, so it can be unticked in place) and
  the workspace's recent activity.
- **Chats** — messages append at the tail and the thread follows them with a smooth scroll;
  a conversation always opens at its newest message. Date dividers (امروز / دیروز / weekday)
  sit in the message flow rather than floating. Seven quick reactions (👍 ❤️ 🔥 🙏 ✅ 👀 👎)
  toggle per member, with counter pills that ring the ones you added. Clicking the header
  title opens the details panel, whose «رسانه‌های مشترک» section is split into tabs with
  counts and empty states: files and documents (size, time, download), photos and videos (a
  grid with a preview dialog), audio (an inline mini player with a scrubber) and links (site,
  title and host, parsed from message text).
- **Tasks** — board, list and Jalali Gantt. The board's columns live in state: the four
  built-ins plus any added from the dashed «افزودن ستون جدید» card (name + accent colour),
  which scrolls the board to its far (left, in RTL) end and focuses the name field. Every
  column's ⋮ menu renames it inline or deletes it: an empty column goes at once; one with
  cards asks whether to move them to another column or archive them. The last column can
  never be deleted, and a task whose column disappears falls back to the first one rather
  than going missing. Search lives in the page header as an expanding icon next to «وظیفه
  جدید». Custom columns take part in drag and drop and keyboard moves; tasks in them count as
  in progress. Every card and row has a quick-complete checkbox: checking moves the task to
  «انجام شد» with a struck-through, muted title; unchecking returns it to the column it came
  from (or «برای انجام» when it has no history). The list view collects completed work in a
  collapsible group. In the Gantt, the task column is `sticky` on the inline-start edge and
  opaque (`z-20`) so bars (`z-10`) slide beneath it over the grid lines (`z-0`), under a
  sticky header (`z-30`).
- **Calendar** — deadlines, meetings, reminders and project milestones only. One toolbar sits
  above the grid: the legend, then the month navigation (previous, month, next, امروز)
  centred on the grid, then «رویداد جدید». A day shows at most two badges; the rest fold into «+X مورد دیگر», which opens the day summary. Clicking
  any day opens the task composer with that Jalali date as the deadline. Deadlines are derived
  from live tasks, never stored twice.
- **Notes** — the list header is the action hub: an expanding search, a folder-plus button
  that creates a category, and the primary «جدید». Below it, horizontally scrolling category
  chips («همه» first and active by default; custom categories with no notes carry a delete
  ✕). A new note lands in the active category, and the editor has a category switcher. In
  edit mode, `- [ ]` / `- [x]` lines render as real checkboxes with inline text inputs —
  Enter adds the next item, Backspace on an empty one leaves the list, typing `[] ` starts
  one — and everything is stored back as plain Markdown. A pinned shelf and colour-tag
  filters sit in the sidebar. «تبدیل یادداشت به وظیفه» opens the
  composer pre-filled; open checklist items become subtasks and the note links to the task.
- **Notification centre** — a drawer from the rail bell with همه / خوانده‌نشده / اشاره‌ها
  tabs, actor avatars, relative Jalali times, per-item and bulk mark-as-read; a card opens its
  task or conversation.
- **Invitations** — one field takes emails and Iranian mobile numbers together. Each entry is
  classified as it is committed: a mobile number in any common form (`09…`, `+98…`, `0098…`,
  grouped with spaces or dashes, Persian or Latin digits) is normalised to `09xxxxxxxxx` and
  invited by SMS; an email is invited by email. Chips and the pending queue carry an envelope
  or handset icon, existing members and pending invitations are flagged per entry, and a
  space inside a half-typed number groups digits instead of committing it.
- **Account** — the profile menu opens «پروفایل من» (presence and status line), «امنیت و
  ورود» (password change with strength meter, SMS two-step sign-in, active sessions) and a
  sign-out confirmation that clears the session state and routes to `/signed-out`.

### Icons

~60 glyphs hand-authored on a 24×24 grid with round caps and joins. Stroke width is computed
as `1.5 × 24 / size`, so a 16px icon and a 24px icon render at an identical 1.5 CSS px —
uniform optical weight across every toolbar. Variants: `linear`, `twotone` (secondary
geometry at 40%) and `bold` (secondary geometry filled, used for active nav states).

---

## Type safety

`strict: true` plus `noUncheckedIndexedAccess`, `noImplicitOverride`,
`noFallthroughCasesInSwitch`, `noUnusedLocals` and `noUnusedParameters`.
**Zero `any` in the codebase**, enforced by `@typescript-eslint/no-explicit-any: error`.

All domain unions are closed and exhaustively switched with a `const exhaustive: never`
guard, so adding a member surfaces as a compile error rather than a runtime fallthrough:
`RoleId`, `PermissionModuleId`, `PermissionActionId`, `TaskStatus`, `TaskPriority`,
`MessageBody`, `ThemeMode`, `AccentId`, `SmartViewId`, `ChatFilterId`, `NotificationEvent`,
`NotificationFilterId`, `CalendarEventKind`, `TagTone`, `Overlay`.

---

## Accessibility

- **Modals, drawers and sheets** implement the full WAI-ARIA dialog contract: `aria-modal`,
  labelled by their title, focus trapped (verified: focus never escapes across 40 tabs),
  Escape to close, background scroll locked (reference-counted for nesting) and focus
  restored to the opener.
- **The inspector** is a docked column on desktop — it does *not* trap focus or lock scroll
  there, because the rest of the app stays interactive — and promotes to a full dialog on
  mobile.
- **Kanban drag and drop has a complete keyboard path**: focus a card, `Space` picks it up,
  arrow keys move it between columns, `Space` drops, `Escape` cancels. Every transition is
  announced through the shell's single `aria-live` region, so the operation is fully
  non-visual. Subtask reordering and the mobile swipe actions likewise have keyboard and
  button equivalents — no interaction is pointer-only.
- **Composite widgets** use roving tabindex (`useRovingFocus`), resolving arrow direction
  from the computed `dir` at keypress time.
- `Select` implements the ARIA 1.2 combobox/listbox contract including `aria-activedescendant`
  and printable-character type-ahead.
- The permission matrix labels each switch by the intersection it controls, so a screen
  reader announces "بوردها و پروژه‌ها — ویرایش، روشن" rather than an anonymous toggle.
  Master switches report `aria-checked="mixed"`; the knob stays fully at the off end (never
  mid-track, in either direction) and shows a dash, so a partial state reads as partial.
- Icon-only controls require a `label` prop at the type level.
- Tables use `<caption>`, `scope` and `aria-sort`.
- A skip link targets `#workspace-main`; `prefers-reduced-motion` disables all animation.

## Layout

**Desktop (≥1024px)** — a four-column shell on a 1440px grid: 64px navigation rail pinned to
the inline-end (right) edge, 300px contextual sidebar, fluid workspace, and a 380px
collapsible inspector. Kanban columns share the available width and only scroll once they hit
their minimum, so all four fit at 1440px with the inspector closed.

**Mobile (375–414px)** — top app bar (workspace switcher, quick create, search,
notifications), five fixed bottom tabs (میز کار · وظایف من · گفتگوها · تقویم · بیشتر — notes
and account actions live under بیشتر) and per-route adaptation: the chat list pushes to a detail view, and the task
list becomes a swipeable single column with the contextual sidebar behind a فیلترها toggle.
Swipe right completes a task, swipe left opens postpone/reassign. Long-pressing a chat bubble
opens a sheet whose primary action is «تبدیل مستقیم به وظیفه», pre-filling the composer with
the message text and any attachment. Verified: zero horizontal overflow on every route at
390px.

## What is not wired yet

The live app persists and synchronises what the screens do through the API: sign-in and
sessions, workspaces, invitations, roles and permissions, projects, the board and its columns,
tasks with subtasks and comments, chat (messages, reactions, read receipts, typing, pins and
mutes), the calendar, notes, notifications and presence. What still stays in the browser:

- **Files.** Nothing uploads yet: workspace icons (the upload is hidden in the live app; the
  monogram is used), chat attachments and voice notes, task attachments.
- **Subtask order.** Reordering subtasks is local; the API has no endpoint for it yet.
- **Message → task.** A task converted from a chat message is created, but its link back to the
  message waits for the bridge endpoint (M4 in RFC 0001).
- **«نامرئی».** The server derives offline from connectivity, so the invisible status is stored
  as «خارج از دسترس».
- **Two-step sign-in.** The SMS code is already the first factor, so the live security dialog
  offers the admin password instead of the demo's SMS two-step switch.

The demo data source (`NEXT_PUBLIC_DATA_SOURCE=demo`) is the complete front end against an
in-memory fixture (`apps/web/src/data/workspace.ts`), which the Playwright suites drive.
Consequences worth stating plainly for it:

- **Voice messages have no audio files.** `VoicePlayer` implements both transports: when a
  message carries a `src` it drives a real `HTMLAudioElement` (seeking, `timeupdate`,
  duration); with `src: null` — the state of a recording that is still uploading — it runs a
  `requestAnimationFrame` clock over the known duration so scrubbing and progress still work.
  The seed data uses the second path.
- **Shared files have no binaries.** Attachments carry `url: null`, so «دانلود» saves a small
  text receipt named after the file; an attachment with a real `url` downloads it directly.
  Media previews are drawn from the file's kind and name.
- **Workspace icons stay in memory.** An uploaded icon is kept as a data URL in state and is
  never sent anywhere; invitations likewise record the channel (email or SMS) without sending.
- **Avatars are generated initials**, not uploaded images, so no binary assets ship in the
  repository. `AvatarTone` selects from the neutral and status ramps rather than the brand
  ramp, so members stay distinguishable when the workspace accent changes.

In the demo, state changes (moving cards, adding, renaming and deleting columns, archiving
tasks, editing permissions, sending messages, creating tasks, events, notes, categories,
invitations and workspaces) are real and flow through the reducer; they reset on reload because
nothing is persisted except the theme. By the same token the demo's account flows are front-end
only: the password form validates locally and records the change time, and signing out resets
the in-memory session — a full reload starts a fresh signed-in session.
